I cannot get the gitpages to populate with the data.  The html menus work, but I've tried pushing from root, along with using raw urls in the code to try to get the data to populate.  I've added a video from the live server that shows I have completed the assignment to the specifications and reverted my code back to the original when it was uploaded.  Any help would be greatly appreciated to make the gitpages work for me.  Thanks in advance.

Fixed the issue with the github pages thanks to the recommendation of the grader. 9/16/2024
